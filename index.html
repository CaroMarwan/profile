              <h3>My name is Marwan Mohsen Ali AL-SEBAEAI, I'm from Yemen originaly and I live in Kuala Lumpur since 2015. My family are holding the American citizens, I have Yemeni passport and as there's war in Yemen, Mr. Trump just sepreate our family and I'm working on myself to prove that we are all human been with no discrimination</h3> 
              <p>I'm applying to this program to learn coding as it is a great opportunity for many reasons:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>It will help me to find a job and support my family.</li>
                  <li>Before people used to consider illiterate is who can't read or write, not long ago illiterate is who can't speak two languages.</li>
                  <li>Now illiterate is who doesn't know codding as I've heard that from Mr. Barack Obama encouraging people to learn it.</li>
                  <li>In the near future, the internet will be free and more people will have access to internet, therefore more web-devlopers are needed</li>
                </ol>
